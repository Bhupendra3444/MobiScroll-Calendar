Lessons Learned
Gained experience in setting up a project with ViteJS.
Learned advanced React state management techniques for drag-and-drop functionality.
Improved CSS styling skills to match complex UI requirements.
Challenges
The most difficult part of the assignment was implementing the drag-and-drop functionality for selecting timelines and moving events seamlessly while maintaining performance and state consistency.

Future Improvements
Given more time, I would:

Add responsive design for mobile and tablet views.
Optimize the drag-and-drop interaction to handle edge cases more gracefully.
Implement tests to ensure the app's robustness.
